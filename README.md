# "CAN YOU DIG IT ?"

I like that question : "Can you dig it ?" meaning "Can you find that beat, mix it with that song and make everybody go crazy about your product ?" 

I'm a big fan of the early days of hip hop. I like the spirit, how it "hacked" all the conventions, how it "opened" the music composition and how it finally ate the music industry. Just like software development.

Like the turntablists back in the days, I'm here to dig into github and contribute to the party.
